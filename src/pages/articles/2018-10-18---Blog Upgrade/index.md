Hello All!

Unfortunately, the old blog was deleted by the VPS provider...so that was the end of that. Fortunately it was in bad need of an upgrade anyways, so I switched from a hosted Wordpress site to a static website using GatsbyJS. I've been doing a ton of ReactJS work lately so remaking the site in React was a huge relief. 

I'm currently working on converting some stuff into markdown and writing a few more articles, so I'll be updating this blog soon. My goal is to get back into the swing of things and hopefully write an article a week. Fingers crossed!
